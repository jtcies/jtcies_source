![Does barring employers from asking about salary history reduce the wage gap? ][header-image]

In January, Philadelphia became the first city to implement a ban on employers asking job candidates about their salary history when Mayor Kenney signed the ban into law. The goal of the law is to increase equity: by not allowing employers to ask about salary history, they won't be able to continue to 

The law makes a lot of sense in theory. And to his credit, Mayor Kenney is trying to make it his mark as a progressive, perhaps one of the most progressive mayor's in the country. This law and the soda tax have received a lot of national attention. Other cities such as New York and San Fransisco appear to be following suit with both similar progressive initatives, and it's refreshing to see Philadelphia leading the charge of these issues. 

All seems good, right? But this law could potentially backfire and harm the people it was intended to help. There's an analogous policy that may shed some light. 

## The BTB comparison

The 'Ban the Box' (BTB) policy intended to improve the employment prospects of ex-offenders. The idea behind BTB is similar: employers won't be allowed to ask someone's criminal record and theorefore won't be able to discriminate against ex-offenders. BTB is essentially the spiritual prescuror to the wage history ban, and it also made a lot of sense in theory. 

In actuality, BTB policies make hiring discrimation **worse**. That was the key finding of a study conducted by researchers from the Univserity of Chicago. They sent out fake job applications to employers before and after the BTB policy went into effect. Some of those applciations had names that sounded white and other black. 

Before the policy went into effect, their results were consistent with what other studies have shown. White applicants to BTB-affected employers received about 7% more call-backs than black applicants. However, after BTB went into effect, white applicants received **45% more call-backs** than black applicants.

```

These results are stunning. Often studies like these will find statistically significant differences and publish them but the differences in reality are pretty minimal. In this case however, the size of the effect is quite substantial. The policy has a major negative imapct on the exact thing that it is trying to address. 

## Well, how do you fix the problem? 

To be clear, I'm not suggesting the law *won't* work, just that we don't know what impact it will have and that, given the BTB findings, there's a fair chance it has the resverse effect. 

The spirit of the law is the right one. The Chamber of Commerce made a number of arguments in its challenge to the law which are wrongheaded and don't seem to hold much water. Strangely, their opposition to the law didn't come out until right before the bill was signed. It's intriguing to me though that the Chamber, nor anyone else for that matter, seems to be questioning whether or not the law which actually work. 

It's one of the problems with this type of policy: by the time someone has something conclusive to say about the effects, the policymakers have moved on to other issues or even positions. And it's not like the evidence from BTB made everybody change their minds; I frequently hear people espouse the benefits of BTB and few are aware of the negative impacts found by the research.
